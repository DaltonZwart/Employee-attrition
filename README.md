ðŸš€ Predicting Employee Attrition with Machine Learning ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

I just completed a data science project where I used machine learning to predict employee attrition!

ðŸ”Ž Key Insights:

Employees with low job satisfaction & poor work-life balance were most likely to leave.
Overtime played a significant role in attrition.
Salary matters, but culture & job satisfaction are bigger factors!
ðŸ’¡ Tools Used:
âœ… Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
âœ… Machine Learning (Random Forest)
âœ… Feature Importance Analysis
